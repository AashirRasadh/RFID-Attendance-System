RFID Attendance System using Raspberry Pi

Overview

This project implements an RFID-based attendance system using a High-Frequency (HF) RFID reader and a Raspberry Pi. The system logs attendance by reading RFID tags and storing the data in a database.

Features

RFID Authentication: Reads RFID tags and verifies attendance.

Data Storage: Stores attendance logs in a database.

Real-time Processing: Immediate logging of scanned RFID data.

User Interface: Displays attendance records.

Scalability: Can be extended with additional features like email notifications, cloud integration, and analytics.

Components Used

Raspberry Pi (any model with GPIO support)

HF RFID Reader

RFID Tags

Database (SQLite/MySQL/PostgreSQL)

Python (for interfacing with RFID reader and database management)
