# ðŸ“š RFID Attendance System using Raspberry Pi 4B

This project is an RFID-based attendance system built using a Raspberry Pi 4B and an MFRC522 RFID reader. It reads RFID card UIDs, matches them with a predefined database of users, displays a welcome message, logs the arrival time, and confirms that the attendance has been recorded.
